# UWM Masters Capstone Project
AI Research Project for UWM Masters Capstone Course

# Introduction
This project explores the application of machine learning to develop an intelligent system 
capable of recommending optimal fingerings for playing notes on the cello. Given a sequence of 
musical notes, characterized by their pitch, duration, and offset within each measure, the system 
will analyze this input to suggest which finger a player should use for each note. Rather than 
relying on a single algorithm, this project will evaluate multiple machine learning approaches to 
determine which are most effective for this task. While the ultimate goal is to create a system 
that generalizes to any piece of music, the primary focus is on beginner-level repertoire, where 
players are most likely to benefit from fingering assistance due to limited technical experience.

Above you will find a pdf report of the project, please refer to this for more details.
